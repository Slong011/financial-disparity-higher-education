# Financial Disparity in Higher Education

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between a student’s family income background and the likelihood of pursuing higher education. Using enrollment and income data from the top 10 largest U.S. universities by student population, a chi-square test and descriptive statistics were conducted to examine disparities in access to higher education based on socioeconomic status.

## Research Question
**Is there a correlation between family income level and college enrollment rates among U.S. universities?**

## Methodology
- A **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test** was conducted to compare the observed proportions of students from the top 5th and bottom 5th income brackets against a hypothesized equal distribution.
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were calculated to examine trends in parent income and enrollment percentages.

## Key Findings
- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 7.64  
- **Critical Value**: 3.84  
- **P-Value**: 0.0057  
- **Conclusion**: Because the test statistic exceeds the critical value and the p-value is below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence that family income background impacts the likelihood of pursuing higher education.
- Across all universities analyzed, students from families in the **top fifth percentile** were **substantially overrepresented** compared to those from the bottom fifth.
